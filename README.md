# 🚀 Java Basics - Day 1 Programming Practice

Welcome to my **Java Basics** project repository! 🎉 This is **week 1** of my Java learning journey, where I have solved **14 beginner-level programs** that cover the foundation of programming logic, number handling, conditions, and arrays.

These programs are designed to build **strong logic-building skills**, improve **problem-solving ability**, and prepare for **technical interviews** for roles like **Automation Tester**, **Java Developer**, or **Full-Stack Developer**.
